this repo contains a set of algorithms applied on graphs, coded with C++. 

the goal of these algorithms is to solve a certain problem ( using exact methods, greedy methods, heuristics and dynamic programming ) in a linear-like time complexity.

to understand the problems i tried to solve, check the header files.

each folder contains a "test" part ( X.test.cc ) , where you can check the complexity of that algorithm and the execution depending on the given problem, of course you can add your own case and check if my implementation works. to execute the tests:

```
// to test the BFS.1.cc, on console type
make BFS.1
```
